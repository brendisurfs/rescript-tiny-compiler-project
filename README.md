# Tiny Compiler Project - Rescript Version
I have been super fascinated with compilers and string parsing
for the last few weeks, and having the super tiny compiler project
just sitting in my starred repos on github, I felt like it was time to
make it happen. I wanted to give it a little twist though.
The two languages I have been having a bit of fun with in my free time
are Grain and Rescript. I thought: why not try to do the project in both,
along with Typescript? So, this is the start of a long journey to:

1. get better at all three languages
2. learn more about compilers so I better contribute to Grain.
3. Have fun.
